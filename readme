Steps for installing

Jython Plugin
- Jython standalone jar file (v2.7b1 tested) needs to be moved to /plugins/Micro-Manager
- JythonMMPlugin.jar (tested with jython v.27b1 and Micro-Manager-1.4.17,1.4.18) needs to be moved to /mmplugins/
- jythonconsole directory needs to be moved to /plugins/Micro-Manager


If all this works you should see a jython console in the plugins dropdown in micromanager.  If should open and run just fine.
In the future this should be replaced by ipython.  It'll make debugging easier.

The firmware should be uploaded

Notes:
    - Tried jython v2.7b2.  Didn't work.
